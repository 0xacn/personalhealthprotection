                <H2>Staying Fit</H2><hr>
                Some news sources say that Americans are exercising less and gaining weight. Others say good nutrition and working out are on the rise. Whichever description fits you is really up to you.
                <br>
                You can make wholesome choices with these strategies:
                <br>
                1. Eat healthy. Cooking at home gives you more control over ingredients and portion sizes. Stock your kitchen with whole foods. Plan your menus and limit snacking.
                <br>
                2. Head outdoors. Green spaces lift your spirits and make working out seem less effortful. Go for a run or play catch in your backyard. Research nearby parks and trails where your family can move around and keep a safe distance.
                <br>
                3. Design a home gym. Set aside a space for cardio and strength training. You can do body weight exercises if you have minimal equipment.
                <br>
                4. Practice self-care. Safeguard your physical and mental wellbeing. Prioritize sleep, physical activity, and nutrition. Think positive and repeat comforting affirmations.
                <br><br>
                Finding Your Purpose
                <br>
                Dealing with any hardship can be an opportunity to build character. Use your extra free time to create a more meaningful life.
                <br>
                Consider these ideas:
                <br>
                1. Meditate and pray. Invest in your spiritual development. Read inspirational texts. Browse online for videos and podcasts that many faith communities are offering. Start a daily meditation practice.
                <br>
                2. Help others. Shifting your attention to others can help you to keep your own troubles in perspective. Ask your favorite charity about how to volunteer online. See if your elderly neighbors need groceries or an occasional phone call.
                <br>
                3. Continue learning. Make a list of subjects you want to explore for your personal enrichment or career advancement. Read books and take courses online. See what your local library has to offer on their website or through curbside services.
                <br>
                4. Limit screen time. Resist the temptation to binge watch TV shows and movies. Save your time and energy for activities with a greater pay off.
                <br>
                You’re probably eager to send your kids to school and share a meal with friends. On the other hand, the pandemic restrictions may have introduced some positive changes that you’ll want to continue. Simple living makes you happier and healthier even when you start cutting back out of necessity.
