        <div class="article-content"><p>Grocery shopping can be one if not the most stressful places right now. Shortages, lines, waiting, and the sheer amount of people is sure to put you off. However, once you're home it's time to make sure you're not bringing germs into your house by sanitizing your groceries.</p><br>
            <h1>Step 1</h1><hr><p>Make a designated area in your home to place the groceries so that they're not all over the place.</p>
            Example: half of the kitchen table
            <br><br>
            <h1>Step 2</h1><hr><p>Get Lysol Wipes or a disinfectant spray. Don't forget a clean pair of gloves.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Step 3</h1><hr><p>Wipe down cans and boxes of food before storing them so you eliminate the spread of germs.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Step 4</h1><hr><p>Once you're done wiping the first cans and boxes, make sure you wash your hands very well so you do not cross-contaminate other groceries.</p>
